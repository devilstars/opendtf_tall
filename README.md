## Pet project. Open "DTF.ru / VC.ru / TJournal.ru" like service.

OpenDTF is an open source website boilerplate based upon the popular Cmtt service network. It attempts to mimic the original service as closely as possible while extending it with new features. If I have time to do it :)

### Technology stack:
- Laravel
- Livewire
- Alpine.JS
- TailwindCSS
- Turbolinks

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ composer install
$ npm install

# serve with watch
$ npm run watch

# or serve with tailwindcss cli
$ npx tailwindcss --postcss -i .\resources\css\app.css -o .\public\css\app.css --watch

# build for production
$ npm run prod
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [laravel docs](https://laravel.com).
